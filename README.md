### 👋 Hi there, this is Shuting Chen. 

> Self-Intro

def Myself():

&emsp;born_in = 🇨🇳 China

&emsp;live_in = 🇺🇸 US

&emsp;undergrad = 🐻 Baylor Univeristy

&emsp;graduate = 🐦 Johns Hopkins University


> I code for the field of Bioinformatics and some softwares. To me, the most fascenating part of being a Binf Engineer is to decode carbon-based life by silicon-based approaches. In this moment, my primary focus is to develop deep neural networks which are biological inspired and could recreate cell actvities such as signaling pathways.
